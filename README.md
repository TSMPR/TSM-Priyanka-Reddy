### About Me

I'm an AI-driven Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, full-stack development, and cloud data workflows. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Pace Institute of Technology and Sciences in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh, India.

I'm skilled in developing powerful APIs with Spring Boot and Java, crafting engaging user experiences with React.js, and building intelligent systems with Python. My goal is to leverage AI and robust software solutions to solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies and contributing to interesting projects.
